# What to do?

## What I want.
I have a dog and I want to teach this dog the behavior "Touch", using positive reinforcement as a technique. 

## Initial situation
- My dog has no conditioning with the word "Touch" at the start. So as long as the dog hasn't learned what to do when I say "Touch" it will show neutral behavior and do nothing. 
- There are things I don't know about yet that my dog likes and its brain will assess as a reward in specific training situations. 
- There are a lot of things I don't know about yet that my dog likes but its brain will not assess as a reward in specific training situations.
- There are even more things I don't know about yet that my dog and its brain are pretty neutral about in in specific training situations.
- There are a few things I don't know about yet that my dog is frightened or upset about and its brain will asses as a punishment in specific training situations.
- I will be able to see a reaction to this things from my dog that will help me to asses if it was a reward.

## How should it look like in the end
My training will be successful:
- When I say "Touch" and hold two fingers so my dog can access them, my dog comes immediately and with joyful body language to me and presses his nose shortly at my two fingers.
