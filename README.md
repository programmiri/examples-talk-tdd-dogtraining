# A Tale About Dog Training and Test-Driven Development
Implementation of the code shown as example in my talk at [RuhrJS 2019](https://ruhrjs.de/) and [FrankenJS](http://frankenjs.org/). 

In hope to enable a better understanding how my workflow was, I comitted every step on it's own, so starting with the first commit you can follow my workflow step by step.

### More about dog training
Seeing as this is still about programming I'll just put one link in here which I think is important :)

[Whatever happend to the term Alpha Wolf](https://www.wolf.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/winter2008.pdf), David Mech, 2008

> "Rather than viewing a wolf pack as a group of animals organized with a “top dog” that fought its way to the top, or amale-female pair of such aggressive wolves, science has cometo understand that most wolf packs are  merely family groupsformed exactly the same way as human families are formed."
